            "    *   Reasoning: The entire right lung field is opaque (appears white), which is a direct and unambiguous observation.\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Consolidation:** 95%\n",
            "    *   Reasoning: The opacification of the collapsed lung is due to the alveoli being filled with fluid or pus instead of air, which is the definition of consolidation. This is an integral part of the overall pathological process.\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Infiltration:** 95%\n",
            "    *   Reasoning: This is a general term describing the substance filling the airspaces. The findings are a severe example of infiltration leading to consolidation and atelectasis.\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Pneumonia:** 80%\n",
            "    *   Reasoning: Severe pneumonia is a very common cause of consolidation and obstructive atelectasis in pediatric patients, often due to mucus plugging associated with infection.\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Lung Lesion:** 70%\n",
            "    *   Reasoning: The entire collapsed right lung represents a major pathological lesion. Furthermore, the underlying cause is likely an obstructing lesion within the right main bronchus (e.g., mucus plug, foreign body, or mass).\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Enlarged Cardiomediastinum:** 40%\n",
            "    *   Reasoning: The cardiomediastinal silhouette is severely displaced and distorted, making an accurate assessment of its true size impossible. The term describes the abnormal appearance, though it's due to shift rather than true enlargement.\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Mass:** 30%\n",
            "    *   Reasoning: An endobronchial mass is a possible cause of the obstruction leading to collapse, although less common than mucus plugging or a foreign body in an infant.\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Cardiomegaly:** 20%\n",
            "    *   Reasoning: True cardiomegaly (enlarged heart) cannot be assessed due to the severe mediastinal shift. There are no specific secondary signs of cardiomegaly.\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Effusion:** 10%\n",
            "    *   Reasoning: A large pleural effusion would cause a contralateral shift (pushing the heart away). The ipsilateral shift seen here argues strongly against a significant effusion. A small, reactive effusion may be present but is not the primary pathology.\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Pleural Thickening:** 10%\n",
            "    *   Reasoning: The right pleura is obscured by the opacified lung, so it cannot be evaluated. There is no evidence of thickening on the left.\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Edema:** 5%\n",
            "    *   Reasoning: The findings are unilateral and associated with volume loss, which is not characteristic of pulmonary edema (which is typically bilateral and diffuse).\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Hernia:** 5%\n",
            "    *   Reasoning: A large right-sided congenital diaphragmatic hernia is a remote possibility but is unlikely, as it would typically cause a contralateral shift and might show bowel gas patterns. The findings are much more typical for atelectasis.\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Fibrosis:** 5%\n",
            "    *   Reasoning: The appearance is of an acute process. Chronic fibrosis presents differently, typically with linear or reticular patterns and more gradual volume loss.\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Pneumothorax:** 0%\n",
            "    *   Reasoning: The radiological findings are the opposite of a pneumothorax (which involves air in the pleural space, appearing as hyperlucency and lung collapse away from the chest wall).\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Nodule:** 0%\n",
            "    *   Reasoning: No discrete nodules are visible. The pathology is a complete opacification of the lung.\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Emphysema:** 0%\n",
            "    *   Reasoning: The left lung shows compensatory hyperinflation (overexpansion), not destructive emphysema. The patient's age makes emphysema extremely unlikely.\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Fracture:** 0%\n",
            "    *   Reasoning: There are no visible signs of rib fractures.\n",

            "*   **Mass:** 30%\n",
            "    *   Reasoning: An endobronchial mass is a possible cause of the obstruction leading to collapse, although less common than mucus plugging or a foreign body in an infant.\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Cardiomegaly:** 20%\n",
            "    *   Reasoning: True cardiomegaly (enlarged heart) cannot be assessed due to the severe mediastinal shift. There are no specific secondary signs of cardiomegaly.\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Effusion:** 10%\n",
            "    *   Reasoning: A large pleural effusion would cause a contralateral shift (pushing the heart away). The ipsilateral shift seen here argues strongly against a significant effusion. A small, reactive effusion may be present but is not the primary pathology.\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Pleural Thickening:** 10%\n",
            "    *   Reasoning: The right pleura is obscured by the opacified lung, so it cannot be evaluated. There is no evidence of thickening on the left.\n",

            "*   **Edema:** 5%\n",
            "    *   Reasoning: The findings are unilateral and associated with volume loss, which is not characteristic of pulmonary edema (which is typically bilateral and diffuse).\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Hernia:** 5%\n",
            "    *   Reasoning: A large right-sided congenital diaphragmatic hernia is a remote possibility but is unlikely, as it would typically cause a contralateral shift and might show bowel gas patterns. The findings are much more typical for atelectasis.\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Fibrosis:** 5%\n",
            "    *   Reasoning: The appearance is of an acute process. Chronic fibrosis presents differently, typically with linear or reticular patterns and more gradual volume loss.\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Pneumothorax:** 0%\n",
            "    *   Reasoning: The radiological findings are the opposite of a pneumothorax (which involves air in the pleural space, appearing as hyperlucency and lung collapse away from the chest wall).\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **Nodule:** 0%\n",

            "*   **Emphysema:** 0%\n",
            "    *   Reasoning: The left lung shows compensatory hyperinflation (overexpansion), not destructive emphysema. The patient's age makes emphysema extremely unlikely.\n",
